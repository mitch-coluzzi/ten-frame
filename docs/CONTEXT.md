## What This Product Is

A guided, interactive **ten-frame subtraction tool** teaching two foundational mental-math strategies to a 6-year-old:

1. **Take from the Ten** — attack the active ten directly, then combine remainders
2. **Break Apart the Subtrahend** — decompose the subtrahend to zero out the ones first, then handle the remainder

Numbers range **0–40** (up to 4 ten-frames). Frames are classified into three visual roles per problem: **spectator** (dimmed, locked), **active-ten** (bright, full ten that will be touched), **active-ones** (bright, partial frame of leftover ones).

Tablet-first, portrait only, fully local — no backend, no API, no env vars.

## Architecture Rules (Locked)

- **Expo managed workflow.** No bare workflow, no native ejection.
- **Local state only** — `useState` / `useReducer`. No Supabase, no API, no env vars.
- **Portrait orientation only** (`app.json`).
- **Theme is the single source of truth** for colors, fonts, sizing, animation timings. No hardcoded colors anywhere outside `theme.js`.
- **Reanimated 2** for all animations (Session B). No `Animated` API mixing.
- **No localStorage / AsyncStorage for preferences in v1.x.** Score tracking deferred to v1.1.
- **Tap targets ≥44px** — driven by `theme.sizing.dotSize`.
- **Minuend constraint:** 1–40. **Subtrahend constraint:** 1..minuend (never below zero).

---

## Stack & Versioning

- **Expo:** ~51.0.0
- **React Native:** 0.74.5
- **React Navigation:** stack v6
- **Reanimated:** ~3.10.1
- **App version:** `APP_VERSION` constant in `App.js` — currently `1.0.0`. Displayed in stack header (`Ten Frame Math  v1.0.0`).
- **Bump rule:** patch on each Claude Code session that ships code; minor on session boundaries (Session A=1.0, Session B=1.1, etc); major at classroom-pilot quality.
- **Repo:** `mitch-coluzzi/ten-frame` (treated as the spec's `/ten-frame/` module root)
- **Local clone:** `/mnt/c/Users/mitch/OneDrive/Desktop/ten-frame`

---

## Workflow Rules (mirrored from SoldFast CRM)

- **Tool approvals:** All tool calls auto-approved. Test environment.
- **Git identity:** Mitch Coluzzi / mitch@soldfast.com
- **Git commands:** All git commands pre-approved. Run `cd` then git as separate Bash calls (never `&&` chained). `git push` authorized.
- **Single-branch workflow:** `main` only.
- **Commit protocol:** Anytime the user prompts to commit, ALWAYS update BOTH `docs/CONTEXT.md` AND `docs/CLAUDE_CHAT_CONTEXT.md` to reflect work just completed BEFORE committing. Include both files in the same commit.
- **No stalling on commits:** push immediately, don't idle.
- **Verify protocol:** When asked to verify/check tree, report current `APP_VERSION` from `App.js` and the session it corresponds to.

## Frame Classifier — How It Works

`src/logic/frameClassifier.js` exports `classifyFrames(minuend, subtrahend)`:

- Builds frames by packing `minuend` dots left→right, top→bottom, 10 per frame.
- Identifies the **rightmost partial frame** (1–9 dots) → `active-ones`.
- Identifies the **rightmost full frame** (10 dots) → `active-ten`.
- All other full frames to the left → `spectator`.
- If `minuend` is a clean multiple of 10, there is no `active-ones` — the last full frame becomes the active-ten.

Example — `34 − 5`:
- Frames 1, 2 → spectator (the 20)
- Frame 3 → active-ten (the full 10)
- Frame 4 → active-ones (the 4)

## Session Log

| Date | Session | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-07 | A | 1.0.0 | Pivot from erroneous vanilla scaffold. Expo scaffold (`package.json`, `app.json`, `babel.config.js`, `App.js`), `theme.js`, `frameClassifier.js`, `DotGrid.js`, `TenFrame.js`, `HomeScreen.js` shipped. Live frame preview wired to minuend/subtrahend inputs. Solve button stubbed pending Session B. |
| 2026-04-07 | A.1 | 1.0.1 | Web parity added: react-dom, react-native-web, @expo/metro-runtime, serve. `app.json` web config (metro bundler, static output). Scripts: dev/web/build/start. Placeholder PNG assets created. `.gitignore` added. JessieProject local folder deleted. Railway auto-deploy via Nixpacks (install → build → start). |
| 2026-04-07 | A.2 | 1.0.2 | Railway build fixes: replaced 1×1 PNGs with valid sized assets (1024 icon, 1284×2778 splash, 48 favicon); switched web `output` from `static` to `single` (SPA, no expo-router required). |
| 2026-04-07 | B | 1.1.0 | **Full app build.** problemLadder + strategyEngine logic. NumberBond component. StrategySelectScreen, SolveScreen (interactive tap-to-remove with auto-advance), ResultScreen (spring answer reveal + "Did you notice?" for tier 3+). All 4 screens registered in App.js. HomeScreen rewritten: vertical input column, green "Start with" palette, navigation wired (DIRECT for tier 1, otherwise StrategySelect). Spectator frames now full color (opacity 1.0) per user feedback. DotGrid + TenFrame extended with interactive/onCellPress/isTarget. Animation: react-native Animated API for instruction pulse + answer spring. |
| 2026-04-07 | C | 1.2.0 | **Addition mode + UX overhaul.** Vertical 5×2 ten-frame layout (column-major fill). Math-style stacked input on Home (right-aligned, sign on left, divider). Green/red palette (greens for ten-frames + Start With + addition; reds for Take Away + subtraction). +/− toggle (radio buttons) on Home. Strategy cards rewritten — numerals only, minimal text, color-coded. NumberBond rotation fixed (was inverted). SolveScreen handles both ops with `mode='add'\|'remove'` on DotGrid; addition uses `classifyAddInitial(a,b)` so frames pre-size to a+b and the user fills empty cells. strategyEngine adds OPERATIONS enum + buildAddSteps (DIRECT, MAKE_A_TEN). problemLadder + needsStrategyChoice + shouldShowPattern signatures take operation. Play Again returns to Home (popToTop). Tier 1 add/sub still skips strategy picker. |
| 2026-04-07 | G.7 | 1.6.7 | **Slower transitions across the board.** Show loop: settle 500→700ms, action read pause 600→900ms, per-dot 900→1100ms, breath 450→900ms, bond/final hold 2400→3200ms, plus a new 1500ms hold before Show→Do transition. Do/Teach auto-advance: bond 1600→2800ms, final 400→2500ms, other non-action 800→1500ms. Mark-then-vanish: 500→1100ms grey hold + new 700ms beat after the visual change before stepping forward. Lillie now has time to see each change land and Jess can narrate over each step. |
| 2026-04-07 | G.6 | 1.6.6 | **Mark-then-vanish for remove + bond label flip on action complete.** In Do/Teach remove actions, tapped dots now turn grey instead of vanishing immediately. State tracked in `markedCellsRef` (a Map of frameIdx → cellIdx[]) with a `markedVersion` counter to force re-renders. After the last marked tap, a 500ms timeout: actually mutates `cells[i] = false` for all marked, clears the ref, and advances the step. Bond satellite label flips at the same moment from the strategy part value (e.g. "10") to the live remaining count (e.g. "3" for 10−7). DotGrid: new `markedCells` prop renders marked filled cells in grey (`#bdbdbd` bg, `#9e9e9e` border), suppresses tappability for already-marked cells. Marked state cleared on phase change, step change, and Start Over. Add actions still mutate immediately (no grey state for adding). |
| 2026-04-07 | G.5 | 1.6.5 | **TenFrame always reserves bond circle space.** Previously when `bondLabel` was null (e.g. spectator frames in aggregate mode), TenFrame skipped rendering the bondCircle and the column was shorter than active TenFrames (which always have a bondCircle above the frame). With cross-column alignment via `framesWrap` flex-end, this caused spectator frames to sit higher than active frames. Fix: TenFrame always renders the bondCircle View with reserved BOND_SIZE × BOND_SIZE space. When `bondLabel` is null, the circle is transparent (no border, no fill, no text). Spectator and active frames now have identical column heights → frame rows align horizontally regardless of which frames have labels. |
| 2026-04-07 | G.4 | 1.6.4 | **Make a Ten addition fix.** Previous bondTargets `['active-ones', 'next-frame']` was wrong because frame role labels in `classifyAddInitial` come from `classifyFrames(SUM)` — the frame currently partial that WILL become full is labeled `active-ten`, and the frame that WILL hold the leftover ones is labeled `active-ones`. Corrected to `['active-ten', 'active-ones']`. Action step targets fixed: fill-the-ten now targets `active-ten`, overflow targets `active-ones`. For 25+7: bond shows 7 → (5)(2) with 5 above the partial frame (currently 5/10) and 2 above the empty frame; 5 fills the ten, 2 lands in ones. |
| 2026-04-07 | G.3 | 1.6.3 | **Spectator aggregate label + mute button fix.** When 2+ spectator frames exist (minuend ≥ 30), the per-frame green (10) labels are suppressed and a single gray aggregate (e.g. "20" for two spectators, "30" for three) is rendered centered above the spectator group. Single-spectator cases (20-29) keep the existing per-frame green (10). No spectators = no change. Mute button rewritten: dropped the wrapping flex row, used `alignSelf: 'flex-end'` directly on the Pressable, switched icon-only to text+icon "🔇 Sound off" / "🔊 Sound on" so it's visible regardless of emoji rendering. |
| 2026-04-07 | G.2 | 1.6.2 | **Audio defaults to muted.** Jess will narrate manually. `narrate.js` `muted` initial value flipped from `false` to `true`. The 🔊/🔇 toggle on Home still works to re-enable. All speak() calls remain in the code; they just no-op while muted. |
| 2026-04-07 | G.1 | 1.6.1 | **Audio quietening per Jess.** Removed per-dot count narration in Show + Do (was distracting). Removed strategy title speech on card tap (Take from 10 / Take from 1 not spoken — bond is enough). Final reveal phrasing changed to "X remain": tier 2 = "9 remain"; tier 3+ = "3 remain, plus 10 equals 13". Action steps now narrate the instruction normally (no count override gating). |
| 2026-04-07 | G | 1.6.0 | **Bond gap closed for Take from 10, count-along audio, start over button, auto-advance non-action steps, bond centered over active group, full add-up narration.** TAKE_FROM_TEN now has a bond step (workingPart = 10 + ones; bondParts [10, ones]; bondTargets [active-ten, active-ones]) and a fixed final step that includes spectator total (e.g. 22-9 → 13). All strategy bond + final steps got `spokenInstruction` fields with kid-friendly phrasing ("five splits into two and three") and full add-up narration on tier 3+ ("3 plus 10 equals 13"). Show loop counts along ("1, 2, 3...") on each dot mutation; Do phase counts along on each valid tap. New restart helper + Start Over button on Solve (Do/Teach). Auto-advance non-action steps in Do + Teach removes the "Next" button requirement. Bond hold extended to 2400ms so TTS can finish. **Spatial bond layout:** framesWrap split into spectatorGroup + activeGroup; bond header (whole + Y lines) renders inside activeGroup so it centers over the active part only, not over all frames. |
| 2026-04-07 | F | 1.5.0 | **Audio narration + bond labels above frames + strategy titles (audio-only).** Added `expo-speech` dep + `src/lib/narrate.js` (speak/stop/setMuted/isMuted/subscribeMute). Speech is global module-level mute, fallback-quiet on errors, web-compatible via Web Speech API. Wired into SolveScreen Show + Do step transitions (Teach is silent), ResultScreen answer reveal, StrategySelectScreen card-tap. Mute toggle 🔊/🔇 on HomeScreen top-right. **Bond labels flipped from below to above each frame** — TenFrame's column now renders bondCircle, then frame. Strategy cards have `title` field (Take from 10 / Take from 1 / Make a 10) used by audio only — not displayed visually. |
| 2026-04-07 | E.6 | 1.4.6 | **Bond Y-lines + grey-out done parts.** Above the framesWrap, the bond whole now renders with two angled `/\` lines below it (gray bars at ±32deg). Bond satellites under target frames track a `bondDone` flag — once `stepIndex` is past the action step that consumes a bond part, that satellite's outline + fill + text switch to a grey palette. Visually communicates "this part is finished, focus on the other one." TenFrame: new `bondDone` prop. SolveScreen: bondDone computed from `stepIndex > bi + 1` (bond part bi is consumed by step bi+1). |
| 2026-04-07 | E.5 | 1.4.5 | **Phase flow polish + persistent bond + hidden equation card.** Watch startup snappier: 500ms hover after load → straight into animation (no per-step read pause). Bond/final hold trimmed (2000→1200ms), action breath trimmed (550→400ms). Watch → Do still auto-transitions. Do → Teach now auto-transitions when the final non-action step is reached (no "Now you try!" button press required). Strategy bond persists across ALL steps in Solve: bondLabel + bondWhole pulled from the first showBond step in `useMemo strategyBond`, applied to every frame render regardless of currentStep. Equation/instruction card under the frames hidden entirely — bonds carry the explanation. |
| 2026-04-07 | E.4 | 1.4.4 | **Spectator-aware Take From Ten bond + SUB b ≤ 10.** TAKE_FROM_TEN strategy card now decomposes the minuend correctly when there are spectator frames: 22 = 10 (locked) + 12, 33 = 20 (locked) + 13. Tier 2 (no spectators, e.g. 14) still uses the simple 14 = 10 + 4 decomposition. NumberBond accepts a `staticParts` array — marked parts get a gray palette and a small "locked" tag. HomeScreen subtraction `b` now capped at 10 (single ten-frame) — `SUB_B_MAX` constant. |
| 2026-04-07 | E.3 | 1.4.3 | **Bond satellites everywhere + Watch stutter fix.** Every TenFrame on Home, Solve, and Sandbox now renders a bond satellite circle showing its current dot count (green). On Solve during the special bond step, the strategy's bondTargets/bondParts mapping takes over with the strategy color. Watch loop refactored to remove dead air at the start: brief 350ms settle, then per-step waits trimmed (action-step initial 1400→700, per-dot 1100→950, breath 900→550, bond/final hold 2800→2000). Show no longer stalls 5+s on the opening bond step. |
| 2026-04-07 | E.2 | 1.4.2 | **Spatial bond, click fix, input clamping.** Bond parts now render as satellite circles directly UNDER the frames they target — TenFrame extended with `bondLabel` + `bondColor` props. Bond `whole` shown as small gray text above the framesWrap. Standalone NumberBond removed from SolveScreen (still used in StrategySelectScreen previews). strategyEngine: BREAK_APART and MAKE_A_TEN bond steps now include `bondTargets` array mapping each part to a frame role ('active-ones'/'active-ten'/'next-frame'). Click fix: NumberBond + EquationLine got `pointerEvents="none"` so they don't intercept clicks meant for parent Pressables; StrategySelectScreen cards switched from Pressable to TouchableOpacity. Input clamping: HomeScreen `sanitizeInput()` strips non-digits and clamps text on every change — for SUB, b ≤ a; for ADD, b ≤ MAX-a; both ≤ 40. Op toggle re-clamps b. |
| 2026-04-07 | E.1 | 1.4.1 | **Bond + equation polish.** NumberBond redesigned: TWO separate circles (one per part), NO `+` between them — Lillie was reading the `+` as another equation. New `EquationLine` component renders LHS with a BLANK BOX where the answer goes (e.g. `10 − 5 = ☐`); strategy cards and SolveScreen instructions both use it now so equations look like prompts rather than completed math. Phase pills are now Pressables — tap to jump back to Watch (or any phase); cancels in-progress Show loop. Watch animation slowed: initial pause 800→1400ms, per-dot 600→1100ms, bond/final hold 1700→2800ms, breath 500→900ms. |
| 2026-04-07 | E | 1.4.0 | **Show / Do / Teach pedagogy.** SolveScreen now runs three sequential phases per problem: (1) **Show** — auto-player demonstrates the problem, frames mutate on a timer (~600ms/dot), instruction text + bond surface in sync, no input required. Skip-ahead button available. (2) **Do** — current guided flow with highlights + hints. (3) **Teach** — bare execution: no highlights, no instruction card, no bond. Hints still pulse on wrong taps (gentle, not punishing). "Your turn!" banner. Phase indicator pills at top of SolveScreen show current phase (👁 Watch / 🖐 Try / 🎓 Show me). Frame state resets on each phase transition. After Teach completes → Result with `taughtIt: true` flag, which surfaces a "You taught it yourself! 🎉" celebration line. **Also fixed:** ScrollView wasn't scrollable on web — added `style={{flex:1}}` and `flexGrow:1` to all four screens (Home, Strategy, Solve, Sandbox). |
| 2026-04-07 | D.1 | 1.3.1 | **Highlight which to tap.** SolveScreen computes a `highlightCells` set per step (last N filled in remove mode, first N empty in add mode). DotGrid renders highlighted cells with a pulsing outer ring (yellow↔orange, 700ms loop) drawn via Animated.Value loop. As cells are tapped the highlight set recomputes to show the next N. Guides without forcing — she can still tap any valid cell. |
| 2026-04-07 | D | 1.3.0 | **Pedagogy pass: any-cell taps, hint/forgive, alt strategy, sandbox, bond emphasis.** Frame state migrated from `dotCount` to `cells: boolean[10]` array — every cell is independently tappable. DotGrid modes: 'remove' (any filled tappable), 'add' (any empty), 'sandbox' (any toggle). SolveScreen wraps frames in outer Pressable for wrong-tap detection → triggers hint pulse (yellow border ring) on target frame. ResultScreen offers "Try the other way" button for sub strategies (TAKE_FROM_TEN ↔ BREAK_APART). New SandboxScreen: 4 frames, free toggle, live total. Home → Free Play button. Home expression now horizontal (`14 + 5` in a row, not stacked). NumberBond redesigned: muted gray whole on top, angled connector lines, parts grouped tight inside a colored pill/oval with `+` between them — strong visual emphasis on decomposition. StrategySelectScreen embeds NumberBond at top of each card, divider, then operation chain in big numerals. |

## Web + Mobile Parity

**Single codebase, two targets.** The Expo project is configured for web export so Railway can serve a static bundle while the same code runs on iOS/Android via Expo Go (and later as a native APK/IPA).

- **Local mobile dev:** `npm run dev` → Expo Dev Tools → scan QR with Expo Go.
- **Local web dev:** `npm run web` → opens in browser via react-native-web.
- **Production web build:** `npm run build` → outputs static bundle to `dist/`.
- **Production web serve:** `npm start` → `serve dist -s -l $PORT` (Railway-compatible).
- **Railway flow:** Nixpacks auto-detects Node, runs `npm install` → `npm run build` → `npm start`. No special config needed.
- **Web deps added:** `react-dom`, `react-native-web`, `@expo/metro-runtime`, `serve`.
- **Web export config:** `app.json` → `expo.web` = `{ bundler: "metro", output: "static" }`.

Both targets update in parallel from the same commit. Any change to `src/` ships to web on push and is picked up by Expo Go on next reload.

## Pre-Build Note for Mitch

`npm install` has not been run yet — `node_modules/` does not exist locally. Before launching the simulator/device, run:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/mitch/OneDrive/Desktop/ten-frame
npm install
npm run dev      # mobile via Expo Go
npm run web      # web via react-native-web in browser
```

Railway will run `npm install && npm run build && npm start` automatically on push.
